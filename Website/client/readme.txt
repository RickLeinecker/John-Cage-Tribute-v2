You might notice several files that are not being used in the actual system. These are leftover from a MERN stack tutorial course on Udemy (which you might have recognized if you took that course). Some of it was taken as a skeleton which I then edited to fit our purposes but much of it was cut out because we just wanted to focus on the main purposes of the web app. The pieces that were cut out include all of the files involving posts and profiles as well as the Experience and Education components. However, I decided to leave them there in the off chance that a future group may want to put it back in somehow.
